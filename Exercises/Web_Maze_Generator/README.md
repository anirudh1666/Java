#Maze Web Game#
----

#Was unable to finish this project. Wasn't able to link the frontend with the backend. I'll comeback to this when I'm motivated to complete it.#

##Goals##
----

- To learn more about developing web applications. How JSPs work and how to let a Java backend communicate with frontend.
- Improve design and implementation of algorithms.
- Learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


##Features##
---

Ideally, this game should allow the user to vary the difficulty by changing the number of cells in the maze. More cells means harder maze.

The bare minimum is to generate and display a maze on a webpage.
