## MAZE GENERATOR ##

**Maze generator** is the precursor program for the Maze Generator web application.

The main aims for this project is to:

- Learn how maze generation algorithms work and implement one.
- Figure out how to display maze in console.
- Add functionality. For example, it should be possible for the user to configure the maze from terminal. Can choose maze difficulty, size and ask for maze to reveal solution.


## Algorithm ##



## V1.0 ##

**IN ALL VERSIONS X COORDINATES REPRESENT ROWS WHILE Y COORDINATES REPRSENT COLUMNS. THIS IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT USUALLY REPRESENTS EG [3,8] MEANS 3RD ROW 8TH COLUMN.**

**Aims:**

- Generate random 5x5 maze in terminal.
- We make sure maze is square not rectangular for now.
